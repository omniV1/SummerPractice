# Project Bookmark: Aircraft Maintenance API

## Overview

This guide provides a summary of the key concepts and progress of the Aircraft Maintenance API project. This project is being developed as a showcase for my skills in ASP.NET Core, React with TypeScript, and MySQL.

## Current Progress

### Project Setup
- **ASP.NET Core Project**: Created an ASP.NET Core Web API project named `AircraftMaintenanceAPI`.
- **Models Created**:
  - `Aircraft`
  - `MaintenanceRecord`
  - `PerformanceMetric`
  - `User`
- **Database Context**: Configured `AircraftMaintenanceContext` to manage the database interactions.
- **Middleware**: Implemented `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` for centralized error handling.
- **Docker Setup**: Created a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to containerize the application and the MySQL database.

### Docker Configuration
- Created a `Dockerfile` to build the ASP.NET Core application.
- Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure and run both the ASP.NET Core application and the MySQL database.
- Added Docker support for both services, including volumes for data persistence and network configuration for inter-service communication.

### Database Setup
- **Entity Framework**: Integrated Entity Framework Core with MySQL using the Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql package.
- **Migrations**: Successfully created and applied the initial migration for the database schema.

## Issues Encountered
- **Non-nullable Warnings**: Several warnings related to non-nullable properties in models (e.g., `Username`, `Password`, `Model`, etc.).
- **Database Connection Error**: Encountered a connection error when attempting to update the database through Docker, indicating the MySQL service wasn't reachable.

## TODOs

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Resolve Non-nullable Warnings**:
   - Address the warnings in the models by either initializing properties or making them nullable where appropriate.

2. **Setup Docker Environment**:
   - Download and install Docker Desktop to manage the Docker containers.
   - Ensure Docker Compose is installed and accessible via the command line.

3. **Run Docker Containers**:
   - Use `docker-compose up --build` to start the services.
   - Verify that the ASP.NET Core application and MySQL database are running correctly.

4. **Database Connection**:
   - Resolve any issues related to database connectivity within the Docker environment.
   - Ensure that the ASP.NET Core application can successfully connect to the MySQL database and perform operations.

### Development and Enhancement
5. **API Endpoints**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for `Aircraft`.
   - Implement CRUD operations for `MaintenanceRecord`.
   - Implement CRUD operations for `PerformanceMetric`.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization endpoints.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Write unit tests for the API endpoints.
   - Perform integration tests to ensure all components work together as expected.
   - Validate input data to ensure the API handles edge cases and invalid data gracefully.

7. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React frontend with TypeScript.
   - Implement user interfaces for managing aircraft, maintenance records, and performance metrics.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API.
   - Ensure proper form validations and error handling on the frontend.

### Deployment and Maintenance
8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
   - Use GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to manage the pipeline.

9. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
   - Secure the API endpoints with appropriate role-based access control.
   - Perform security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

10. **Documentation**:
    - Document the API endpoints using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
    - Write detailed README and documentation for setting up and running the project.
    - Provide usage examples and API documentation for developers.

### Final Steps
11. **User Feedback and Iteration**:
    - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
    - Iterate on the feedback to improve the application.

12. **Final Testing and Launch**:
    - Perform final testing to ensure everything works as expected.
    - Deploy the application to a production environment.
    - Monitor the application post-launch for any issues or improvements.

## How to Resume

1. **Download Docker Desktop**: Install Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. **Start Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
3. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. **Build and Run Containers**: Execute `docker-compose up --build` to start the services.
5. **Verify Services**: Check that both the API and MySQL database are running correctly.
