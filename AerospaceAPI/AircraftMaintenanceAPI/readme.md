# Aircraft Maintenance API

This project is a RESTful API for managing aircraft maintenance records.

## Major Checkpoints

### Project Setup
- [x] **Initialized Project Structure**: Set up the basic directory structure and initialized a new ASP.NET Core project.
- [x] **Added Essential Packages**: Installed necessary packages including EntityFrameworkCore, MySqlConnector, and ASP.NET Core tools.

### Database Integration
- [x] **Database Configuration**: Configured MySQL database connection in `appsettings.json`.
- [x] **Entity Framework Integration**: Set up Entity Framework Core with MySQL and created `AircraftMaintenanceContext` for database operations.
- [x] **Database Migrations**: Generated initial database migrations and applied them to create the database schema.

### CRUD Operations Implementation
- [x] **Created Models**: Defined models for `Aircraft`, `MaintenanceRecord`, `PerformanceMetric`, and `User`.
- [x] **Created DbContext**: Set up `AircraftMaintenanceContext` to manage the database context.
- [x] **Implemented Controllers**: Developed `AircraftsController` with CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Middleware and Error Handling
- [x] **Custom Middleware**: Implemented `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` to handle and log exceptions.
- [x] **Status Code Pages**: Configured status code pages to return JSON responses for API errors.

### Unit and Integration Testing
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Wrote unit tests for service methods.
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Created integration tests using Postman for API endpoints, including tests for response status, content type, and schema validation.

### Documentation
- [x] **API Documentation**: Documented API endpoints and example requests/responses in Postman.
- [x] **README Update**: Detailed documentation of the project setup, API endpoints, and progress in README.md.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- [ ]**CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests (work in progress).

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- MySQL server
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Postman (for testing API endpoints)

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AircraftMaintenanceAPI.git
cd AircraftMaintenanceAPI

### Setup the Database

Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Then, create a new database for the project:

CREATE DATABASE AircraftMaintenanceDB;

### Configure Connection String

Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your MySQL configuration:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=AircraftMaintenanceDB;user=root;password=Bannana"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}

### Restore Dependencies

Restore the project's dependencies using the .NET CLI:

dotnet restore

### Apply Database Migrations

To ensure your database schema is up to date, apply the migrations:

dotnet ef database update

### Run the Application

Run the application using the .NET CLI:

dotnet run

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5240`.
